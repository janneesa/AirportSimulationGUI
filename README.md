# Airport Simulator - Java Project
<br />
Airport Simulator is a Java-based simulation project designed to model customer flow through various airport service points, including check-in, security, and gates. The project aims to analyze queue times and optimize service processes for different scales of airport operations.

<h2> Description </h2>
The Airport Simulator project was developed as part of Metropoliaâ€™s Object-Oriented Programming course. It implements a three-phase simulation model to simulate customer movement through key airport service points, such as check-in counters, self-check-in kiosks, security checks, and gates. 
The simulation models customer flow, analyzes wait times, and measures the efficiency of service processes, helping optimize airport operations. The final product includes an intuitive JavaFX-based graphical user interface (GUI) with adjustable parameters for customer flow, service points, and service times. 

<h2> Key Features </h2>
- Simulates customer flow through airport service points.
- Analyzes wait times, service efficiency, and potential bottlenecks.
- Customizable parameters such as customer flow rates and service times.
- Intuitive, real-time visualizations of queues and service point statuses.
- Ability to save and load previous simulations for comparative analysis.
